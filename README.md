Usage: python3 degrees.py numberofmovements# rad|deg lengthofmovement# anglemod# key lock > encryption 

(1st program optional either remove the position, or come up with your own encryption for the position, I wont help you there as thats for modelling, failure to make a decision will not let the final output work.)

Instead if you do not decide to make a decision, you can use a wordlist of your choosing for encryption file, this will not include Positional modelling

usage: python3 CTE.py encryption, file, output.py

USAGE : python3 output.py


Compiled this is what the positions look like in the example ecryption
